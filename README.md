# Junk-d
Gamified Waste Management System  Households and users log waste pickups or recycling via QR code tags.  Get points (tokenized via blockchain or simple backend) and redeem for rewards.  Add AI image recognition to detect garbage types (recyclable, e-waste, etc.).

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Waste management in urban and semi-urban areas is inefficient, unengaging, and lacks real-time user participation. Citizens often don't feel incentivized to properly segregate or recycle their waste.

---

## 🎯 Our Solution: Junk’d

Junk’d is a gamified, AI-powered waste management platform that turns boring trash disposal into a fun, rewarding, and competitive experience.

### 🔑 Key Features

- 📲 QR-based Waste Logging  
  Users scan QR tags on their bins to log waste pickups and types. Each scan earns points.

- 🧠 AI Waste Type Detection  
  Built-in AI model detects garbage type (plastic, organic, e-waste, etc.) via image recognition before logging.

- 🪙 EcoPoint Token System  
  Users earn EcoPoints based on the type & volume of waste recycled. Points can be redeemed for real-life rewards.

- 🎁 Rewards Marketplace  
  Points can be exchanged for brand coupons, sustainable products, or donation credits.

- 🏆 Community Leaderboards  
  Neighborhoods, hostels, and schools can compete on sustainability metrics.

- 🧾 Smart Waste Reports  
  Track your personal eco-impact and waste stats. Admins can view zone-based analytics.
