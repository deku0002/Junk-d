♻️ Junk’d – Gamified Waste Sorting & Recycling App
🚀 Project Idea Submission – Hackathon 2025
Team Name: vibe_coders
Project Name: Junk’d
Category: Sustainability / AI / Smart Cities / Web3
Tech Stack:

Frontend: React Native (Mobile App)

Backend: Java (Spring Boot + MySQL/MongoDB)

AI Module: Python (TensorFlow/Keras + Flask API)

QR Code Scanner: React Native plugin or device camera

Token System: Junk’d Coin (off-chain in DB or on-chain via Polygon/Firebase)

🌍 Problem Statement
Most people don’t recycle because it feels like a chore with no reward. Cities struggle with inefficient waste segregation, and recyclables get mixed into landfills.

🎯 Our Solution: Junk’d
A fun, gamified app where users snap a picture of their waste before disposal. Our Python-based AI checks for correct sorting and recyclable content. Scores convert to Junk’d Coins, which can be exchanged for rewards. Users compete on leaderboards and track their environmental impact.

🔑 Key Features
📸 AI Waste Sorting Score (Python)
Built using Python (TensorFlow or OpenCV), hosted via a lightweight Flask API

Classifies waste image into categories: plastic, paper, e-waste, organic, metal, mixed

Assigns a score based on:

Whether the waste is correctly sorted

Presence of recyclable items

Cleanliness or contamination (future enhancement)

📲 QR Code Waste Logging
Each household/bin has a unique QR

Users scan the bin QR, upload image of waste

Image & QR pair is sent to backend for verification + scoring

🪙 Junk’d Coin Token System
Score from AI → converted into Junk’d Coins

Stored in user's wallet

Coins can be redeemed for:

Coupons (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart)

Eco-products (e.g., reusable bags, compost bins)

Donation to green initiatives

🏆 Leaderboards & Community Challenge
Daily, weekly, and monthly leaderboards

Compete by location (hostel, school, society)

Top recyclers earn bonus coins & badges

📈 Smart Reports
Users can track:

Waste recycled

Coins earned

CO2 saved (estimated)

Admins can view zone-wise data and trends

💡 Why "Junk’d"?
Because your junk just earned you real value. Junk’d turns boring waste disposal into a flex-worthy sustainability game.
